**Problem:**

During our undergraduate life, we stayed in a shared accommodation (commonly known as a "mess" where students rent a home and share all rent and bills). Calculating individual costs from the combined expenses of everyone, which include house rent, food, utility bills, internet connection, security fee, etc., used to be a hassle. The cost ratio is not the same for everyone, making manual calculation tedious and error-prone.

**Solution:**

To address this problem, I developed software that automates the calculation of individual costs from the combined expenses. This tool takes into account the varying cost ratios for each person and simplifies the entire process, saving time and reducing errors.

**Features:**

**Automated Calculation:**

Input combined expenses and individual cost ratios.
Get individual costs calculated instantly.

**Flexible Ratios:**

Accommodates different cost-sharing ratios for different individuals.

**Comprehensive Coverage:**

Includes all types of expenses such as house rent, food, utility bills, internet connection, security fee, etc.
User-Friendly Interface:

Easy to input data and obtain results with just one click.

**Benefits:**

Efficiency: Saves time by automating complex calculations.
Accuracy: Reduces the risk of human errors in manual calculations.
Convenience: Simplifies the process of managing shared expenses.
